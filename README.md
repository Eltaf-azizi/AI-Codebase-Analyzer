<h1 align="center">AI Codebase Analyzer</h1>

AI Codebase Analyzer is a local developer tool that turns a ZIP archive of a codebase into instant architecture, security, and logic insights using AI. It combines a React frontend, an Express backend, Google Gemini embeddings, and a semantic search/chat interface to help engineers understand unknown repositories faster.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Accepts a `.zip` archive of a source code repository through a browser upload
- Extracts text-based source files while excluding common binary and dependency folders
- Builds an in-memory vector store of code chunks for semantic search
- Generates a structured project analysis with architecture, feature detection, security observations, and improvement recommendations
- Provides an interactive file explorer, syntax-highlighted preview, and visual dependency graph
- Supports conversational codebase queries using AI-powered retrieval augmented generation (RAG)

## 📦 Features

- ZIP upload and backend ingestion via `POST /api/upload`
- File filtering for `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, common binaries, and unreadable files
- Intelligent file chunking for functions, classes, and modules
- Dependency extraction from import/require statements
- Google Gemini model integration for summary and chat
- Semantic search using cosine similarity over embedded code chunks
- Interactive UI with drag-and-drop upload, file search, and chat history
- D3-based architecture dependency graph visualization

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

### Backend

- `server.ts`
  - Express server listening on port `3000`
  - Uses `multer` memory storage for file uploads
  - Extracts ZIP contents with `adm-zip`
  - Filters out excluded directories and binary extensions
  - Provides a health endpoint at `/api/health`
  - Uses Vite middleware in development and serves static files in production


### Frontend

- `src/App.tsx`
  - Main React application and page layout
  - Upload flow, analysis dashboard, file explorer, code preview, and chat interface
  - Uses `motion` for animation and `Tailwind CSS` for styling
  - Includes syntax highlighting via `react-syntax-highlighter`

- `src/components/architectureGraph.tsx`
  - Visualizes file dependency relationships using D3

### AI + Search Services

- `src/services/aiService.ts`
  - Initializes the AI model client and vector store
  - Generates structured project analysis
  - Answers chat queries using relevant context from the codebase

- `src/services/parseService.ts`
  - Splits files into code chunks by functions/classes/modules
  - Detects imports and external dependency references

- `src/services/vectorStore.ts`
  - Manages in-memory embeddings and similarity search

- `src/types/index.ts`
  - Shared TypeScript interfaces for files, analysis results, messages, and graph data

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm
- Google Gemini API key

## 🔧 Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure the Gemini API key:

```powershell
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

3. Start development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## 🧪 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` — Start the Express + Vite development server
- `npm run build` — Build the frontend for production with Vite
- `npm run preview` — Preview the production build locally
- `npm run clean` — Delete the generated `dist` folder
- `npm run lint` — Run TypeScript type checking with `tsc --noEmit`

## 💡 Usage

1. Create a `.zip` archive of the repository or codebase you want to analyze.
2. Open the app in your browser.
3. Drag and drop the ZIP or click to upload.
4. Wait for the backend to extract files and generate analysis.
5. Browse the file explorer, inspect source files, and use the AI chat for questions.
